1101,"Python is case sensitive, meaning 'Variable' and 'variable' are different. It's like treating your ex and your best friend the same — bad idea. Variable naming must respect this or you'll trigger errors and possibly existential dread."
1102,"A function in Python is a reusable block of code defined using the `def` keyword. Example: `def greet(): print('Hi')`. It lets you avoid writing the same code 700 times like a caveman."
1103,"Lists are mutable — you can change them. Tuples are immutable — they’re the locked vault of Python. Use tuples when you don’t want your data altered, and lists when you enjoy chaos."
1104,"`if` checks a condition. `elif` (else if) checks more if the first fails. `else` catches everything else. It's like triage in code: check symptoms, more symptoms, then panic if none match."
1105,"Use a `for` loop with `range()`. Example: `for i in range(5): print(i)` repeats 5 times. It’s basically your digital alarm clock for making stuff repeat — without snooze."
1106,"Indentation in Python replaces braces. It's not aesthetic — it literally controls the code blocks. Get it wrong and Python sulks with an IndentationError."
1107,"Use `if number % 2 == 0:` to check if it's even, else it's odd. If that `%` confuses you, it’s the modulo operator — math’s way of keeping you humble."
1108,"`def` defines a function. Think of it like signing a contract: 'def' says you’re starting something formal that you better finish properly, or Python revolts."
1109,"`range(n)` gives you numbers from 0 to n-1. Perfect for loops. `range(3)` gives 0,1,2. It doesn’t include the end — because Python likes to be mysterious."
1110,"`=` assigns a value. `==` checks if two values are equal. Mixing them up is like texting your boss 'I love you' — unintended and awkward."
1111,"Create with `my_list = []`, add with `my_list.append('item')`. Congratulations, you’ve made a dynamic container that can hoard anything like a digital goblin."
1112,"`None` is Python’s way of saying 'nothing here'. It’s used when a variable exists but doesn’t have a value — kind of like your weekend plans."
1113,"`input('Prompt')` lets the user type something. It always returns a string — so don’t expect a number unless you convert it. Otherwise: crash incoming."
1114,"A `for` loop repeats over items in a sequence. Example: `for x in [1,2,3]: print(x)` prints each number. Like a robotic chant, but useful."
1115,"Define a string with quotes: `'hello'` or `'world'`. Operations include concatenation (`+`), repetition (`*`), slicing (`[:]`), and escaping from reality."
1116,"Indexing starts at 0. `my_list[0]` is the first item. `[-1]` is the last. Just remember: counting starts from zero or Python throws shade."
1117,"Use `[start:stop:step]`. It's like slicing cake — clean, elegant, and non-destructive (unless you mess up the indices)."
1118,"`print()` shows output. `return` sends data back from a function. Use `return` when you want to use the result later instead of shouting into the void."
1119,"Use `len(obj)` to get how many items are in a list or how long a string is. Python counts so you don’t have to (because counting is for loops)."
1120,"Use `int('123')` to convert a string to an integer. If it’s not a number (like 'cat'), Python has a meltdown and throws a `ValueError`."
1121,"Python will throw a `ZeroDivisionError`. Because dividing by zero is mathematically illegal. Even Python respects that law of the universe."
1122,"Use `#` to write a comment. It won’t run, but it's great for explaining your mess to future-you (who will definitely forget what your code does)."
1123,"Use `if item in list:` to check existence. It’s like asking Python: 'Is this in the fridge?' Python replies with True or False, minus the sass."
1124,"A syntax error means your code is written wrong — like a sentence missing a verb. Python just stares blankly until you fix it."
1125,"Whitespace in Python defines blocks. Other languages ignore it, Python makes it sacred. Misalign your indentation and boom — disaster."
1126,"Use `def my_func():` to create, then `my_func()` to call. It’s basically setting a trap and then stepping into it — intentionally."
1127,"A variable is a name for storing data: `x = 5`. It's your way of telling Python: 'Remember this thing for later, OK?'"
1128,"Mutable = changeable (lists). Immutable = untouchable (tuples, strings). Choose wisely or face unintended consequences."
1129,"`break` exits the loop early. `continue` skips to the next iteration. Use when your loop needs to rage quit or skip awkward moments."
1130,"A `while` loop repeats as long as a condition is True. Great for unknown loop counts or infinite regret. Example: `while x < 10:`"
1131,"Use `==`, `<`, `>`, `!=`, etc. for comparisons. Python evaluates them to True/False — the language of judgment and logic."
1132,"Booleans are `True` and `False`. They're used in conditions and control flow — like on/off switches for your code's decisions."
1133,"Use `'sub' in 'string'` to check if one string is in another. If you’re searching for love or typos, this operator has your back."
1134,"`not` reverses a Boolean. `not True` is False. It's like Python’s way of saying: 'Plot twist!'"
1135,"`and` requires both conditions to be True. `or` needs at least one. `not` flips the result. They’re Python’s logic gatekeepers."
1136,"A `TypeError` happens when you use a wrong type. Example: `3 + 'a'` is like adding a banana to a math problem — Python freaks out."
1137,"Use `int()`, `str()`, and `float()` to convert types. Because Python won’t just assume what you mean — it's not your psychic assistant."
1138,"Both quotes work for strings. Use single quotes unless the string has apostrophes. Or double quotes if you're feeling fancy."
1139,"Escape characters like `\\n` (newline) and `\\t` (tab) let you format strings. Without them, you'd be stuck printing in a straight line like it's 1995."
1140,"Use `+` to concatenate: `'hello' + 'world'` = `'helloworld'`. For actual space between them, don’t forget to add it manually like `'hello ' + 'world'`."
1141,"Use `*` with strings: `'ha'*3` gives `'hahaha'`. Useful for evil laughter or creating long strings when you’re too lazy to type."
1142,"List comprehension is a compact way to build lists. Example: `[x*2 for x in range(5)]` gives `[0,2,4,6,8]`. Fancy, fast, and confusing to beginners."
1143,"Use `for item in list:` and `print(item)`. Python will loop over each item like a butler reading off a grocery list."
1144,"`enumerate()` gives both index and value. Example: `for i, v in enumerate(my_list):` — now you know what you're yelling at."
1145,"Use `max(list)` and `min(list)` to find the extremes. Because manual searching is for spreadsheets, not Pythonistas."
1146,"Use `list.sort()` or `sorted(list)` for ascending. For descending, pass `reverse=True`. Yes, Python can sort your life — just not emotionally."
1147,"`append()` adds to the end. `remove()` deletes the first match. It’s a push/pull friendship dynamic — in code form."
1148,"`pop()` removes and returns the last item (or given index). It’s like a toaster: it ejects your data back at you."
1149,"Use `copy()` or slicing for shallow copy. Deep copy (with `copy.deepcopy`) copies nested objects too. Shallow is quick but risky, like most shortcuts."
1150,"Use slicing `[::-1]` to reverse a list or string. Or `reversed()` for lists. It’s Python’s built-in time machine — in reverse."
1151,"A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Unlike lists that use numeric indices, dictionaries use custom keys. Think of it as a labeled box rather than a numbered shelf."
1152,"Create with `my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}`. Access with `my_dict['a']`. If you ask for a key that doesn't exist, Python throws a fit (KeyError)."
1153,"A key-value pair links a unique key to a value: `'name': 'Charlie'`. Keys must be immutable. Values can be anything, even your emotional baggage."
1154,"`get(key)` fetches the value or returns `None` if the key doesn’t exist — avoiding errors and drama. You can also use a default: `get('age', 99)`."
1155,"Use `if key in my_dict:`. If it returns True, the key exists and is plotting something. Otherwise, it’s a ghost key."
1156,"Use `for key, value in my_dict.items():` to loop like a civilized coder. Bonus: no need to access by key manually."
1157,"`==` checks if values are equal. `is` checks if they're literally the same object in memory. Like comparing twins vs. clones — subtle but crucial."
1158,"Combine conditions using `and`, `or`, and `not`. Example: `if x > 0 and y < 10:`. Because sometimes one condition just isn’t enough chaos."
1159,"A nested `if` is an `if` inside another `if`. Use it when you want layered decision-making, or just want to confuse future-you reading the code."
1160,"`pass` is a placeholder. It does nothing — like your New Year’s resolution. Use it when Python demands a block but you’re not ready to commit."
1161,"A module is a file with Python code you can import. Use `import math` or `import os`. It’s like ordering pre-cooked functions instead of making your own."
1162,"Create a `.py` file with your functions. Save it, then import it in another script using `import mymodule`. Boom — you’ve made your own toolkit."
1163,"The `math` module provides advanced math functions like `math.sqrt()` and `math.pi`. Basically, it’s Python’s math degree in a box."
1164,"Use `import math as m` to nickname it. `m.sqrt(9)` is shorter and lazier — and we love that."
1165,"Use `from math import pi` to import specific items. Now you can use `pi` directly, no prefix. Ideal for people who hate typing."
1166,"Local variables live inside functions. Globals are everywhere. If you modify a global from inside a function, Python side-eyes you unless you say `global`."
1167,"Default arguments provide fallback values. `def greet(name='friend'):` lets you call `greet()` without panic. Think of them as polite defaults."
1168,"Too few = `TypeError`. Too many = also `TypeError`. Python is strict about function arguments — like a bouncer at Club Function()."
1169,"A return value is the result a function gives back. Use `return` to hand it off. Otherwise, your function just runs off into the void."
1170,"Parameters are the variables in the function definition. Arguments are the actual values you pass in. It’s like a recipe vs. the ingredients."
1171,"Use `def foo(a, b=0):`. You can now call `foo(5)` or `foo(5, 2)`. Optional parameters make your function chill and flexible."
1172,"Use `try:` to attempt something risky, and `except:` to catch the error if it explodes. Like wearing padding before a Python faceplant."
1173,"A `ValueError` occurs when a value is of the right type but wrong content. Catch it with `except ValueError:`. It’s the 'wrong mood' of errors."
1174,"Use `open('file.txt', 'r') as f:` and then `f.read()` or `f.readline()`. Reading files — Python’s way of digging through your digital drawers."
1175,"Open the file with `'w'` mode and use `f.write('text')`. Don’t forget to close it — or better, use `with` to auto-close like a responsible adult."
1176,"`with open(...) as f:` ensures the file is automatically closed. Like hiring a babysitter who leaves when the parents come back."
1177,"Loop with `for line in f:`. Each loop gives you the next line. It’s like reading a diary, line by line — but with permission."
1178,"Use `os.path.exists('file.txt')` or try to open it with `try/except`. That way you avoid errors and look smarter than you are."
1179,"Integer division uses `//`. Float division uses `/`. Mixing them is legal — but know what you want, or Python will guess (and probably be wrong)."
1180,"Use `round(3.14159, 2)` for 2 decimals. Or don’t round at all and pretend precision matters that much in your life."
1181,"Use `f\'Hello, {name}\'` to insert variables into strings. It’s readable, modern, and lets you feel cool while formatting."
1182,"Use `'{} {}'.format('Hello', 'world')`. It’s older but still classy — like writing with a fountain pen instead of a Sharpie."
1183,"`print()` displays output to the screen. `return` sends output from a function to be used later. Print shouts. Return hands you a note."
1184,"Use a list: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`. It’s a box that can store multiple values — or secrets you want Python to remember."
1185,"Python throws `IndexError`. Because trying to grab a non-existent item is like reaching into an empty cookie jar — disappointing and dangerous."
1186,"Python checks the first condition. If it’s true, it runs the block. Else it moves on. It doesn’t care about your intentions — just your booleans."
1187,"Use `list.count(value)`. It tells you how many times something shows up. Like a popularity contest, but for integers."
1188,"Looping over a string gives characters. Over a list gives items. So `'cat'` gives `'c', 'a', 't'`, and `[1,2,3]` gives numbers. Easy peasy."
1189,"`zip()` combines multiple iterables into tuples. It’s Python’s way of pairing socks (or lists). Example: `zip([1,2], ['a','b'])` → `[(1,'a'), (2,'b')]`."
1190,"Use `for i, v in enumerate(list):`. It’s Python’s way of saying: 'Here’s the item AND where it lives. Use it wisely.'"
1191,"Truthy values behave like True. Falsy values behave like False. `0`, `''`, `[]`, `None` are falsy. Everything else is like 'yup'."
1192,"Use `if string:` to check if it's not empty. Or `if not string:` for the opposite. Simple, elegant, and highly judgmental."
1193,"Use `' '.join(list)` to merge list items into a string with spaces (or any delimiter). It’s the glue of the string world."
1194,"`strip()` removes whitespace from both ends. Useful when dealing with user input, messy text, or existential whitespace issues."
1195,"`upper()` = ALL CAPS. `lower()` = all lowercase. `capitalize()` = Only First Letter. They’re your case-shifting power trio."
1196,"Use `string.replace('old', 'new')`. It replaces all occurrences. If it doesn’t, you probably typed it wrong. Again."
1197,"Use `split()` to break a sentence into words. Default is space. It’s Python’s word blender — efficient and messy."
1198,"Use `strip()` for both ends, `lstrip()` for left, `rstrip()` for right. They’re like virtual scissors — gentle but effective."
1199,"You get a `TypeError`. Floats aren’t valid list indices. Python wants integers. Try it and Python will scold you accordingly."
1200,"`in` checks for membership. `'a' in 'cat'` → True. `3 in [1,2,3]` → True. If it’s not there, Python returns False and maybe judges you."
