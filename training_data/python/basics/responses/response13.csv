1201,"Use `type(variable)` to see what data type you're working with. It's Python’s way of saying, 'Know thy variable before you mess it up.'"
1202,"Meaningful variable names make your code readable and less like a cryptic prophecy. `total_price` > `tp`. Future you will thank you."
1203,"`for` loops iterate over a sequence. `while` loops keep going until a condition breaks. One’s structured; the other’s chaos in a loop."
1204,"Infinite loops happen when the exit condition never becomes False. Fix it or Python will loop like it’s Groundhog Day forever."
1205,"Use `elif` when you’ve got multiple paths. Like: `if`, `elif`, `elif`, then `else` as a safety net for indecisive logic."
1206,"In `if` statements, `else` runs if nothing above is true. In loops, `else` runs if the loop wasn't broken. It’s the 'bonus round.'"
1207,"Indentation isn’t cosmetic in Python — it defines code blocks. Inconsistent indentation = Python throws a tantrum (IndentationError)."
1208,"`+=` adds and assigns in one go: `x += 5` is shorthand for `x = x + 5`. Less typing, more progress, fewer carpal tunnel injuries."
1209,"`NoneType` is the type of `None`. It appears when a function returns nothing or when you've ghosted a variable by not assigning it."
1210,"Use `a, b = b, a`. Python makes value swapping a one-liner. No need for a temp variable. Elegant, unlike your sleep schedule."
1211,"Use triple quotes like `'''` or `\'\'\'` to span strings over multiple lines. Great for poems, long messages, or passive-aggressive notes."
1212,"Use `#` to write comments. They’re ignored by Python but adored by future humans trying to decode your spaghetti logic."
1213,"Convert float to int: `int(3.7)` → 3. Convert int to float: `float(3)` → 3.0. Python handles conversions better than some diplomats."
1214,"The `%` operator returns the remainder. `7 % 3` → 1. Use it for checking divisibility, wrapping around, or acting fancy in interviews."
1215,"`bool()` turns stuff into True or False. `bool(0)` → False. `bool('hello')` → True. It’s Python’s gut-check for truthiness."
1216,"Use `if a % b == 0:` to check divisibility. If the remainder is 0, congrats — the number is evenly divisible (and probably smug about it)."
1217,"`isinstance(x, int)` checks type. Better than `type(x) == int` because it works with inheritance too. Like a respectful class check."
1218,"Python says no and raises a `TypeError`. You can’t add a string and an integer — it’s like trying to mix oil and water in code."
1219,"`round(3.14159, 2)` → 3.14. It trims decimals politely. Without the second argument, it rounds to the nearest whole number."
1220,"You get repetition. `'ha' * 3` → `'hahaha'`. Python obeys your chaos request and multiplies string enthusiasm."
1221,"Use slicing: `s[::-1]` reverses a string. It’s Python's quietest magic trick — no loops, no drama."
1222,"Shallow copy: `copy()` — copies outer list, not nested ones. Deep copy: `copy.deepcopy()` — clones everything like it’s in a sci-fi lab."
1223,"`in` checks if an item exists. `==` checks equality. Use `in` when looking for membership, not identity. Don’t force commitment."
1224,"Use `list1 + list2` to merge. It creates a new list. Great for combining forces, like a superhero crossover — but with data."
1225,"Use `list(set(my_list))` to remove duplicates. Be warned: it may scramble your order — like memory after a wild weekend."
1226,"Use `list.index(value)` to find where something lives. If it’s not there, Python throws a tantrum — ValueError style."
1227,"You get a `ValueError`. Python doesn’t remove what doesn’t exist — it prefers you check first or be ready to catch the drama."
1228,"Use `list.insert(index, value)` to surgically place an element. Like: `colors.insert(1, 'blue')` shoves 'blue' into slot 1."
1229,"Use slicing: `list[::2]` gives every second element. Python skips with style — like hopscotch but with data."
1230,"Negative indices count from the end. `list[-1]` = last item. `list[-2]` = second to last. Python is cool like that."
1231,"A nested list is a list inside a list. Access it like `list[0][1]`. It's list-ception. Dive deep but don’t get lost."
1232,"Use nested loops or list comprehension. Example: `flat = [item for sublist in nested for item in sublist]`. Python flattens with flair."
1233,"Loop through each character and check `if c.lower() in 'aeiou':`. Count your vowels like they owe you money."
1234,"Use a loop or list comprehension: `[s.upper() for s in list_of_strings]`. Instant uppercase makeover — no caps lock needed."
1235,"Use `' '.join(list_of_words)`. This merges them with spaces, like polite conversation between list items."
1236,"Escape sequences like `\\n` (newline) and `\\t` (tab) help format text. They start with `\\` because Python needs a warning first."
1237,"Use `.count('word')` after splitting the sentence. Example: `sentence.split().count('apple')` counts apple propaganda."
1238,"Check if `s == s[::-1]`. If True, it’s a palindrome. If not, it’s just pretending to be symmetrical."
1239,"Use `s.isdigit()` to see if it’s all numbers. Works like a bouncer — strict but fair."
1240,"`isalnum()` checks for letters and numbers. `isalpha()` checks for only letters. Numbers not allowed in the alphabet club."
1241,"Use `re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)` from the `re` module. Or go full DIY and filter out characters manually. Your call, gladiator."
1242,"Use `sum(1 for c in s if c.isupper())`. Python counts capital letters like it's running a secret grammar check."
1243,"Use `s.startswith('sub')` or `s.endswith('sub')`. Like checking if a story begins or ends with drama."
1244,"Empty list: `[]`. Empty string: `''`. Empty dictionary: `{}`. All ready to be filled with your hopes, dreams, or runtime errors."
1245,"`not` flips a condition. `not True` → False. It’s the grammatical equivalent of a passive-aggressive no."
1246,"Using `//` gives integer division. So `7 // 2` → 3. `7 / 2` → 3.5. One truncates, the other respects decimals. Choose wisely."
1247,"Wrap risky code in `try: ... except:`. If Python panics, you catch the error and stop your program from combusting."
1248,"Use `raise ValueError('your message')` to throw your own error. It's like yelling at your code with structure."
1249,"`finally:` always runs — whether there’s an error or not. Great for cleanup, emotional closure, or sarcastic logging."
1250,"`try-except` handles actual errors. `if` checks conditions. `if` is preventive; `try-except` is reactive — like therapy vs. aspirin."
1251,"Use `{k: v for k, v in iterable}` to create a dictionary from a loop or condition."
1252,"Use `sorted(dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])` to sort by values."
1253,"Use `dict.keys()` and `dict.values()` to get keys and values."
1254,"Use `dict.update({'new_key': 'value'})` to add or update entries."
1255,"Use `dict.pop('key', None)` to delete a key without error if it doesn’t exist."
1256,"Use `for k, v in dict.items(): print(k, v)` to loop through a dictionary."
1257,"Access like `data['outer']['inner']` — each level uses another `[]`."
1258,"Use `if not my_list:` — it checks if the list is empty."
1259,"`elif` lets you chain multiple conditions. `else` is just the final fallback."
1260,"Because `True` is 1 and `False` is 0 under the hood. Boolean = integer in disguise."
1261,"`all()` checks if all are True, `any()` checks if at least one is True."
1262,"Use `my_list.reverse()` — it changes the list in place."
1263,"Loop and use `if x % 2 == 0:` to collect even numbers."
1264,"Use `continue` to skip items: `if x == bad: continue`."
1265,"`id(obj)` returns the memory address — proves two names point to the same object."
1266,"Use `del var` to delete variables or `del list[i]` to remove items."
1267,"`for-else` runs the `else` if the loop wasn't exited with `break`."
1268,"Use `range(1, 101)` to get numbers from 1 to 100."
1269,"Check divisibility from 2 to √n; if none divide, it's prime."
1270,"Use `sorted(my_list)` to get a sorted copy. Original list stays intact."
1271,"Use `sum(nums) / len(nums)` — classic average formula."
1272,"Check `all(x == nums[0] for x in nums)` to see if all are the same."
1273,"Use `merged = dict1 | dict2` in Python 3.9+."
1274,"Use `for char in string:` to loop through each character."
1275,"Compare with `<` or `>` like `if s1 < s2:` — works alphabetically."
1276,"Use `f'{value:.2f}'` to format float to two decimal places."
1277,"Use `.replace()` with a loop or regex to swap vowels for '*'."
1278,"Use `char * n` to repeat it. Example: `'x' * 5` → `'xxxxx'`."
1279,"Use `all(x in big_list for x in small_list)` to check for a subset."
1280,"Use list comprehension: `[x for x in list1 if x in list2]`."
1281,"Use `max(words, key=len)` to find the longest word."
1282,"Use `.istitle()` — returns True if each word starts with uppercase."
1283,"Use `.islower()` — returns True if all letters are lowercase."
1284,"Use `len(set(s)) != len(s)` — duplicates exist if lengths differ."
1285,"Use `.replace(' ', '')` or `.split()` + `join()` to remove spaces."
1286,"Use `.isidentifier()` — returns True if string is a valid variable name."
1287,"Python raises `NameError`. Functions must be defined before they’re called."
1288,"Pass it like `func(callback)` — functions are first-class objects."
1289,"Python uses indentation to group code blocks. No braces, just whitespace."
1290,"Use `\\` or parentheses to break long lines. Python appreciates the courtesy."
1291,"Escape quotes with backslashes: `'It\\'s fine'` or use double quotes around single."
1292,"Use `\\` at the end of a line to continue it. Rare, but possible."
1293,"Both exit Python, but they're meant for interactive use — not scripts."
1294,"Use commas: `print(a, b, c)` — prints all with spaces in one go."
1295,"Use `print('hi', end='')` to suppress the newline."
1296,"`==` compares contents. Two lists with same items return True, even if different objects."
1297,"Use `[x for x in list1 if x in list2 and x not in result]` to find intersection manually."
1298,"`None` evaluates to `False` in Boolean context — it's a void, after all."
1299,"`+=` adds and reassigns. `=+` just sets the variable to a positive value."
1300,"Use `is` to test identity: `a is b` is True only if they point to the same object."
