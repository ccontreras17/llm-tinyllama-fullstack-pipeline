1101,Explain why Python is case sensitive and how it affects variable naming.,"Python is case sensitive, meaning 'Variable' and 'variable' are different. It's like treating your ex and your best friend the same — bad idea. Variable naming must respect this or you'll trigger errors and possibly existential dread."
1102,Explain what a function is in Python and how to define one.,A function in Python is a reusable block of code defined using the `def` keyword. Example: `def greet(): print('Hi')`. It lets you avoid writing the same code 700 times like a caveman.
1103,Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python.,"Lists are mutable — you can change them. Tuples are immutable — they’re the locked vault of Python. Use tuples when you don’t want your data altered, and lists when you enjoy chaos."
1104,"Explain how the `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements work in Python.","`if` checks a condition. `elif` (else if) checks more if the first fails. `else` catches everything else. It's like triage in code: check symptoms, more symptoms, then panic if none match."
1105,Explain how to create a loop that repeats a block of code a specific number of times.,Use a `for` loop with `range()`. Example: `for i in range(5): print(i)` repeats 5 times. It’s basically your digital alarm clock for making stuff repeat — without snooze.
1106,Explain the use of indentation in Python and why it matters.,Indentation in Python replaces braces. It's not aesthetic — it literally controls the code blocks. Get it wrong and Python sulks with an IndentationError.
1107,Explain how to check if a number is even or odd in Python.,"Use `if number % 2 == 0:` to check if it's even, else it's odd. If that `%` confuses you, it’s the modulo operator — math’s way of keeping you humble."
1108,Explain the purpose of the `def` keyword in Python.,"`def` defines a function. Think of it like signing a contract: 'def' says you’re starting something formal that you better finish properly, or Python revolts."
1109,Explain how the `range()` function works and how it's used in loops.,"`range(n)` gives you numbers from 0 to n-1. Perfect for loops. `range(3)` gives 0,1,2. It doesn’t include the end — because Python likes to be mysterious."
1110,Explain the difference between `=` and `==` in Python.,`=` assigns a value. `==` checks if two values are equal. Mixing them up is like texting your boss 'I love you' — unintended and awkward.
1111,Explain how to create a list in Python and add elements to it.,"Create with `my_list = []`, add with `my_list.append('item')`. Congratulations, you’ve made a dynamic container that can hoard anything like a digital goblin."
1112,Explain what `None` means in Python and when it’s used.,`None` is Python’s way of saying 'nothing here'. It’s used when a variable exists but doesn’t have a value — kind of like your weekend plans.
1113,Explain how to use the `input()` function to get user input in Python.,`input('Prompt')` lets the user type something. It always returns a string — so don’t expect a number unless you convert it. Otherwise: crash incoming.
1114,Explain what a `for` loop does in Python.,"A `for` loop repeats over items in a sequence. Example: `for x in [1,2,3]: print(x)` prints each number. Like a robotic chant, but useful."
1115,Explain how to define a string and perform basic string operations in Python.,"Define a string with quotes: `'hello'` or `'world'`. Operations include concatenation (`+`), repetition (`*`), slicing (`[:]`), and escaping from reality."
1116,Explain how indexing works in strings and lists in Python.,Indexing starts at 0. `my_list[0]` is the first item. `[-1]` is the last. Just remember: counting starts from zero or Python throws shade.
1117,Explain how to slice a list or string in Python using colon syntax.,"Use `[start:stop:step]`. It's like slicing cake — clean, elegant, and non-destructive (unless you mess up the indices)."
1118,Explain the difference between `print()` and `return` in a function.,`print()` shows output. `return` sends data back from a function. Use `return` when you want to use the result later instead of shouting into the void.
1119,Explain how to use the `len()` function to find the length of a string or list.,Use `len(obj)` to get how many items are in a list or how long a string is. Python counts so you don’t have to (because counting is for loops).
1120,Explain how to convert a string to an integer in Python.,"Use `int('123')` to convert a string to an integer. If it’s not a number (like 'cat'), Python has a meltdown and throws a `ValueError`."
1121,Explain what happens when you divide by zero in Python.,Python will throw a `ZeroDivisionError`. Because dividing by zero is mathematically illegal. Even Python respects that law of the universe.
1122,Explain how to write a comment in Python and why comments are important.,"Use `#` to write a comment. It won’t run, but it's great for explaining your mess to future-you (who will definitely forget what your code does)."
1123,Explain how to check if an item exists in a list using `in`.,"Use `if item in list:` to check existence. It’s like asking Python: 'Is this in the fridge?' Python replies with True or False, minus the sass."
1124,Explain what a syntax error is in Python and how to avoid it.,A syntax error means your code is written wrong — like a sentence missing a verb. Python just stares blankly until you fix it.
1125,Explain how Python handles whitespace differently than other languages.,"Whitespace in Python defines blocks. Other languages ignore it, Python makes it sacred. Misalign your indentation and boom — disaster."
1126,Explain how to create and call a simple Python function.,"Use `def my_func():` to create, then `my_func()` to call. It’s basically setting a trap and then stepping into it — intentionally."
1127,Explain what a variable is in Python and how to assign one.,"A variable is a name for storing data: `x = 5`. It's your way of telling Python: 'Remember this thing for later, OK?'"
1128,Explain the difference between mutable and immutable types in Python.,"Mutable = changeable (lists). Immutable = untouchable (tuples, strings). Choose wisely or face unintended consequences."
1129,Explain the `break` and `continue` statements in loops.,`break` exits the loop early. `continue` skips to the next iteration. Use when your loop needs to rage quit or skip awkward moments.
1130,Explain how to use the `while` loop and what it’s good for.,A `while` loop repeats as long as a condition is True. Great for unknown loop counts or infinite regret. Example: `while x < 10:`
1131,Explain how to compare two values in Python.,"Use `==`, `<`, `>`, `!=`, etc. for comparisons. Python evaluates them to True/False — the language of judgment and logic."
1132,Explain what a Boolean value is and how it's used in Python.,Booleans are `True` and `False`. They're used in conditions and control flow — like on/off switches for your code's decisions.
1133,Explain how to check if a string contains another string in Python.,"Use `'sub' in 'string'` to check if one string is in another. If you’re searching for love or typos, this operator has your back."
1134,Explain how to use the `not` operator in Python.,`not` reverses a Boolean. `not True` is False. It's like Python’s way of saying: 'Plot twist!'
1135,"Explain how logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` work in Python.",`and` requires both conditions to be True. `or` needs at least one. `not` flips the result. They’re Python’s logic gatekeepers.
1136,Explain what a `TypeError` is and when you might encounter one.,A `TypeError` happens when you use a wrong type. Example: `3 + 'a'` is like adding a banana to a math problem — Python freaks out.
1137,"Explain how to use the `int()`, `str()`, and `float()` functions for type conversion.","Use `int()`, `str()`, and `float()` to convert types. Because Python won’t just assume what you mean — it's not your psychic assistant."
1138,Explain the difference between single quotes and double quotes for strings in Python.,Both quotes work for strings. Use single quotes unless the string has apostrophes. Or double quotes if you're feeling fancy.
1139,Explain how escape characters like `\\n` and `\\t` work in Python.,"Escape characters like `\\n` (newline) and `\\t` (tab) let you format strings. Without them, you'd be stuck printing in a straight line like it's 1995."
1140,Explain how to concatenate strings using the `+` operator.,"Use `+` to concatenate: `'hello' + 'world'` = `'helloworld'`. For actual space between them, don’t forget to add it manually like `'hello ' + 'world'`."
1141,Explain how to repeat a string multiple times using the `*` operator.,Use `*` with strings: `'ha'*3` gives `'hahaha'`. Useful for evil laughter or creating long strings when you’re too lazy to type.
1142,Explain what a list comprehension is and give a simple example.,"List comprehension is a compact way to build lists. Example: `[x*2 for x in range(5)]` gives `[0,2,4,6,8]`. Fancy, fast, and confusing to beginners."
1143,Explain how to loop through a list and print each item.,Use `for item in list:` and `print(item)`. Python will loop over each item like a butler reading off a grocery list.
1144,Explain what the `enumerate()` function does in Python.,"`enumerate()` gives both index and value. Example: `for i, v in enumerate(my_list):` — now you know what you're yelling at."
1145,Explain how to find the maximum and minimum values in a list.,"Use `max(list)` and `min(list)` to find the extremes. Because manual searching is for spreadsheets, not Pythonistas."
1146,Explain how to sort a list in ascending and descending order.,"Use `list.sort()` or `sorted(list)` for ascending. For descending, pass `reverse=True`. Yes, Python can sort your life — just not emotionally."
1147,Explain what the `append()` and `remove()` methods do in a list.,`append()` adds to the end. `remove()` deletes the first match. It’s a push/pull friendship dynamic — in code form.
1148,Explain how to use the `pop()` method and what it returns.,`pop()` removes and returns the last item (or given index). It’s like a toaster: it ejects your data back at you.
1149,Explain how to copy a list in Python and the difference between shallow and deep copy.,"Use `copy()` or slicing for shallow copy. Deep copy (with `copy.deepcopy`) copies nested objects too. Shallow is quick but risky, like most shortcuts."
1150,Explain how to reverse a string or list in Python.,Use slicing `[::-1]` to reverse a list or string. Or `reversed()` for lists. It’s Python’s built-in time machine — in reverse.
1151,Explain what a dictionary is and how it differs from a list.,"A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Unlike lists that use numeric indices, dictionaries use custom keys. Think of it as a labeled box rather than a numbered shelf."
1152,Explain how to create and access values in a dictionary.,"Create with `my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}`. Access with `my_dict['a']`. If you ask for a key that doesn't exist, Python throws a fit (KeyError)."
1153,Explain what a key-value pair is in Python dictionaries.,"A key-value pair links a unique key to a value: `'name': 'Charlie'`. Keys must be immutable. Values can be anything, even your emotional baggage."
1154,Explain how to use the `get()` method with dictionaries and why it’s useful.,"`get(key)` fetches the value or returns `None` if the key doesn’t exist — avoiding errors and drama. You can also use a default: `get('age', 99)`."
1155,Explain how to check if a key exists in a dictionary.,"Use `if key in my_dict:`. If it returns True, the key exists and is plotting something. Otherwise, it’s a ghost key."
1156,Explain how to loop through a dictionary using a `for` loop.,"Use `for key, value in my_dict.items():` to loop like a civilized coder. Bonus: no need to access by key manually."
1157,Explain the difference between `is` and `==` in Python.,`==` checks if values are equal. `is` checks if they're literally the same object in memory. Like comparing twins vs. clones — subtle but crucial.
1158,Explain how to use multiple conditions in an `if` statement.,"Combine conditions using `and`, `or`, and `not`. Example: `if x > 0 and y < 10:`. Because sometimes one condition just isn’t enough chaos."
1159,Explain what a nested `if` statement is and when to use it.,"A nested `if` is an `if` inside another `if`. Use it when you want layered decision-making, or just want to confuse future-you reading the code."
1160,Explain the purpose of the `pass` statement in Python.,`pass` is a placeholder. It does nothing — like your New Year’s resolution. Use it when Python demands a block but you’re not ready to commit.
1161,Explain what a module is and how to import one.,A module is a file with Python code you can import. Use `import math` or `import os`. It’s like ordering pre-cooked functions instead of making your own.
1162,Explain how to create your own Python module.,"Create a `.py` file with your functions. Save it, then import it in another script using `import mymodule`. Boom — you’ve made your own toolkit."
1163,Explain what the `math` module is and give an example of using it.,"The `math` module provides advanced math functions like `math.sqrt()` and `math.pi`. Basically, it’s Python’s math degree in a box."
1164,Explain how to use `import as` to give a module a nickname.,Use `import math as m` to nickname it. `m.sqrt(9)` is shorter and lazier — and we love that.
1165,Explain how to use the `from ... import ...` syntax.,"Use `from math import pi` to import specific items. Now you can use `pi` directly, no prefix. Ideal for people who hate typing."
1166,Explain the difference between global and local variables in Python.,"Local variables live inside functions. Globals are everywhere. If you modify a global from inside a function, Python side-eyes you unless you say `global`."
1167,Explain how default arguments work in Python functions.,Default arguments provide fallback values. `def greet(name='friend'):` lets you call `greet()` without panic. Think of them as polite defaults.
1168,Explain what happens if you call a function with the wrong number of arguments.,Too few = `TypeError`. Too many = also `TypeError`. Python is strict about function arguments — like a bouncer at Club Function().
1169,Explain what a return value is in Python functions.,"A return value is the result a function gives back. Use `return` to hand it off. Otherwise, your function just runs off into the void."
1170,Explain the difference between arguments and parameters in functions.,Parameters are the variables in the function definition. Arguments are the actual values you pass in. It’s like a recipe vs. the ingredients.
1171,Explain how to define a function with optional parameters.,"Use `def foo(a, b=0):`. You can now call `foo(5)` or `foo(5, 2)`. Optional parameters make your function chill and flexible."
1172,Explain how to handle errors in Python using `try` and `except`.,"Use `try:` to attempt something risky, and `except:` to catch the error if it explodes. Like wearing padding before a Python faceplant."
1173,Explain what a `ValueError` is and how to catch it.,A `ValueError` occurs when a value is of the right type but wrong content. Catch it with `except ValueError:`. It’s the 'wrong mood' of errors.
1174,Explain how to open and read a text file in Python.,"Use `open('file.txt', 'r') as f:` and then `f.read()` or `f.readline()`. Reading files — Python’s way of digging through your digital drawers."
1175,Explain how to write text to a file using Python.,"Open the file with `'w'` mode and use `f.write('text')`. Don’t forget to close it — or better, use `with` to auto-close like a responsible adult."
1176,Explain what the `with` statement does when working with files.,`with open(...) as f:` ensures the file is automatically closed. Like hiring a babysitter who leaves when the parents come back.
1177,Explain how to iterate over each line in a file.,"Loop with `for line in f:`. Each loop gives you the next line. It’s like reading a diary, line by line — but with permission."
1178,Explain how to check if a file exists using Python.,Use `os.path.exists('file.txt')` or try to open it with `try/except`. That way you avoid errors and look smarter than you are.
1179,Explain how to handle division of integers and floats in Python.,"Integer division uses `//`. Float division uses `/`. Mixing them is legal — but know what you want, or Python will guess (and probably be wrong)."
1180,Explain how to round a number to a certain number of decimal places.,"Use `round(3.14159, 2)` for 2 decimals. Or don’t round at all and pretend precision matters that much in your life."
1181,Explain how to use `f-strings` to format output in Python.,"Use `f\'Hello, {name}\'` to insert variables into strings. It’s readable, modern, and lets you feel cool while formatting."
1182,Explain how to format strings using the `format()` method.,"Use `'{} {}'.format('Hello', 'world')`. It’s older but still classy — like writing with a fountain pen instead of a Sharpie."
1183,Explain the difference between `print()` and `return` in terms of output.,`print()` displays output to the screen. `return` sends output from a function to be used later. Print shouts. Return hands you a note.
1184,Explain how to store multiple values in a single variable using a list.,"Use a list: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`. It’s a box that can store multiple values — or secrets you want Python to remember."
1185,Explain what happens when you use an index that is out of range in a list.,Python throws `IndexError`. Because trying to grab a non-existent item is like reaching into an empty cookie jar — disappointing and dangerous.
1186,Explain how Python evaluates conditions in an `if` statement.,"Python checks the first condition. If it’s true, it runs the block. Else it moves on. It doesn’t care about your intentions — just your booleans."
1187,Explain how to count how many times a value appears in a list.,"Use `list.count(value)`. It tells you how many times something shows up. Like a popularity contest, but for integers."
1188,Explain the difference between a for loop over a string and over a list.,"Looping over a string gives characters. Over a list gives items. So `'cat'` gives `'c', 'a', 't'`, and `[1,2,3]` gives numbers. Easy peasy."
1189,Explain what the `zip()` function does and how it’s used.,"`zip()` combines multiple iterables into tuples. It’s Python’s way of pairing socks (or lists). Example: `zip([1,2], ['a','b'])` → `[(1,'a'), (2,'b')]`."
1190,Explain how to get both the index and value when looping through a list.,"Use `for i, v in enumerate(list):`. It’s Python’s way of saying: 'Here’s the item AND where it lives. Use it wisely.'"
1191,Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in Python.,"Truthy values behave like True. Falsy values behave like False. `0`, `''`, `[]`, `None` are falsy. Everything else is like 'yup'."
1192,Explain how to test if a string is empty in Python.,"Use `if string:` to check if it's not empty. Or `if not string:` for the opposite. Simple, elegant, and highly judgmental."
1193,Explain how to use the `join()` method to merge list items into a string.,Use `' '.join(list)` to merge list items into a string with spaces (or any delimiter). It’s the glue of the string world.
1194,Explain the purpose of the `strip()` method for strings.,"`strip()` removes whitespace from both ends. Useful when dealing with user input, messy text, or existential whitespace issues."
1195,"Explain the difference between `upper()`, `lower()`, and `capitalize()` in Python.",`upper()` = ALL CAPS. `lower()` = all lowercase. `capitalize()` = Only First Letter. They’re your case-shifting power trio.
1196,Explain how to replace part of a string using the `replace()` method.,"Use `string.replace('old', 'new')`. It replaces all occurrences. If it doesn’t, you probably typed it wrong. Again."
1197,Explain how to split a sentence into a list of words.,Use `split()` to break a sentence into words. Default is space. It’s Python’s word blender — efficient and messy.
1198,Explain how to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.,"Use `strip()` for both ends, `lstrip()` for left, `rstrip()` for right. They’re like virtual scissors — gentle but effective."
1199,Explain what happens when you use a float as a list index.,You get a `TypeError`. Floats aren’t valid list indices. Python wants integers. Try it and Python will scold you accordingly.
1200,Explain what the `in` keyword does when used with strings and lists.,"`in` checks for membership. `'a' in 'cat'` → True. `3 in [1,2,3]` → True. If it’s not there, Python returns False and maybe judges you."
